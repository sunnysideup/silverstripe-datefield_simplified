datefield simplified
================================================================================

A simple date field.  It does not add a calendar (use DateField for this),
but you can type any date you like (e.g. today, yesterday, +2 weeks, 11/12/2014,11-23-2015, etc... )
and it is likely to understand what you mean.

This is great for dates that are not close to a particular default date (e.g. DOB) where using a calendar
is more hassle than purpose.
